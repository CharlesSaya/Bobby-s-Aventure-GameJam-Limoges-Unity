Game developped during the Global GameJam 2020

The power plant exploded and is therefore strewn with cracks in its walls. Bobby, must use his oversized duct tape to seal all the cracks before the plant explodes. Look out! There is Radiation emanating from the cracks. They destroy Bobby's limbs. If Bobby loses all his limbs, he dies. Lucky for Bobby, he can patch up his body with the limbs scavenged on his colleagues who died in the disaster. Good luck, try to fill in the cracks and take care of Bobby!
